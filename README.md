这是一个基于 Java 的物理游戏项目，名为 Inkball，玩家通过绘制线条引导小球进入正确的目标区域，同时避开障碍物。游戏侧重于基于物理的运动和时机掌控，提供具有挑战性的玩法机制。

This is a Java-based game project called Inkball, where players control the movement of balls within a set boundary, capturing them in the correct sequence while avoiding obstacles. The game focuses on physics-based movement and timing, offering challenging gameplay mechanics.

项目简介 | Introduction
Inkball 是一个基于物理的游戏，玩家通过绘制线条将小球引导到对应的目标区域。游戏具有多个逐渐增加复杂度的关卡，随着关卡进展，更多障碍物和机制被引入。

Inkball is a physics-based game developed in Java, where players must guide multiple balls into their respective goals using drawn lines. The game features several levels with increasing complexity, introducing new obstacles and mechanics as players advance.

安装 | Installation
按照以下步骤启动项目：

Follow these steps to get started:

克隆仓库 | Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/hym-fei/java.git
cd inkball-java

确保已安装 Gradle 和 Java | Ensure you have Gradle and Java installed on your system:
java -version
gradle -v

使用 Gradle 运行项目 | Run the project using Gradle:
gradle run

使用方法 | Usage
运行游戏后，玩家可以通过鼠标绘制线条，将小球引导到对应颜色的目标区域。每个关卡都有不同颜色的小球和目标，目标是引导小球避开障碍物，进入匹配的目标区。

Once the game is running, players can draw lines with the mouse to direct the balls into the correct goals. The objective is to guide the balls to matching-colored goals while avoiding obstacles.
